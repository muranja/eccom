# Why Buy Refurbished?

In Kenya, buying a brand new laptop can cost upwards of KES 80,000. However, high-quality **ex-UK** business laptops offer the same performance for half the price.

## Top Pick: HP EliteBook 840 G5

The G5 is our number one recommendation for students and professionals.
- **Metal Body**: It can survive a drop.
- **Speed**: The 8th Gen Core i5 is faster than most new Celerons found in budget laptops.
- **Price**: At KES 35,000, it is a steal.
