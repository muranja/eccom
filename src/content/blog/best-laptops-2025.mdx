## Top Pick: HP EliteBook 840 G5
*The Executive Standard.*

The **HP EliteBook 840 G5** is currently the best-selling refurbished laptop in Nairobi. Why? Because it hits the perfect sweet spot between price, performance, and portability.

<TechSpecsTable specs={[
  { key: "Processor", value: "Intel Core i5 8th Gen (Quad-Core)" },
  { key: "RAM", value: "8GB DDR4 (Upgradable to 32GB)" },
  { key: "Storage", value: "256GB NVMe SSD" },
  { key: "Display", value: "14-inch Full HD (1920x1080)" },
  { key: "Build", value: "Aluminum Chassis" },
  { key: "Audio", value: "Bang & Olufsen Speakers" }
]} />

### Why We Recommend It
Unlike the older G3 or G4 models which were bulky and plastic, the G5 features a **modern, slim aluminum design** that looks professional in any meeting. 

The **8th Generation Intel Core i5** is a massive leap over the 7th Gen, offering four cores instead of two. This means it can handle coding, video editing, and heavy multitasking with ease.

## 3 Things to Check When Buying Refurbished

1.  **The Generation:** Always check the sticker. Ensure it says "8th Gen" or higher (e.g., i5-8xxx). Anything older (6th/7th Gen) will not run Windows 11 officially.
2.  **The Screen:** Ask for "FHD" (Full HD). Avoid the lower resolution "HD" screens which look pixelated.
3.  **The Battery:** Run a quick battery health report (cmd: `powercfg /batteryreport`) before paying.
