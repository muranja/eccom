## HP EliteBook 840 G3 Price in Kenya - Budget Business Class

The **HP EliteBook 840 G3** is the best-selling budget refurbished laptop in Nairobi. For under KES 20,000, you get a machine that was originally worth over 100k. It's slimmer than the G2 and marks the shift to silver business aesthetics.

### Why It's the "Mwananchi" Choice
**Unbeatable Price:** At KES 20,000, it competes with slow Celeron laptops but offers Core i5 performance.
**Parts Availability:** Every repair shop in Nairobi has parts for this laptop. Screen replacements, batteries, and keyboards are cheap and plentiful.
**Good Enough Performance:** The 6th Gen processor is still surprisingly capable for web browsing, Word documents, and watching movies.
