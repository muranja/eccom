The **A17 Pro chip** is a monumental leap in silicon design. Built on the industry's first 3-nanometer process, it features a GPU that allows for hardware-accelerated ray tracing. This means games like *Resident Evil Village* and *Assassin's Creed Mirage* run natively on your phone with lighting and reflections that were previously only possible on high-end PCs or consoles.
