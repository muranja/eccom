## Dell Latitude 7490 Price in Kenya - The Business Workhorse

The **Dell Latitude 7490** is widely regarded as one of the best business laptops ever made. Refurbished units in Kenya offer incredible value for money, giving you a simplified yet durable carbon-fiber enriched body and excellent battery life.

### Why Choose the Latitude 7490?

**Carbon Fiber Durability:** Unlike the aluminum HP, the 7490 uses a soft-touch carbon fiber weave (on specific models) or high-grade magnesium alloy. It feels warm to the touch and offers excellent grip.

**Superior Keyboard:** Dell's keyboards are legendary. The deep key travel and tactile feedback make typing long reports or code a pleasure.

**Color Accurate Display:** The 14-inch FHD IPS panel covers **118% of the sRGB color gamut**, making it significantly more vibrant than standard business laptops. This is perfect for slight photo editing or enjoying movies.
