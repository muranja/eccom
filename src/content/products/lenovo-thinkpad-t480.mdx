## Lenovo ThinkPad T480 Price in Kenya - Indestructible & Iconic

The **Lenovo ThinkPad T480** is legendary in the Nairobi tech community. Known for its "hot-swappable" dual battery system and tank-like build quality, it is the ultimate laptop for field engineers and power users.

### Why the T480 is a Legend

**Power Bridge Technology:** The T480 has *two* batteries. One internal, one external. You can swap the external one without turning off the laptop, giving you theoretically infinite battery life if you carry spares.

**Military Grade Spec:** Passed 21 MIL-SPEC tests. It withstands dust, vibration, heat, and drops better than any other laptop in its class.

**The TrackPoint:** The famous "red dot" allows you to control the mouse without moving your hands from the home row, maximizing efficiency.
