### Deep-Dive: RGBW Sensor Technology & AMOLED Brilliance

The "secret sauce" of the Camon 20's camera is the **RGBW (Red-Green-Blue-White) sensor**. Unlike standard sensors, it adds a white sub-pixel that captures more light. In practical terms for Kenyans, this means that your photos taken during late-night dinners in Westlands or sunset walks in Nakuru will be brighter and less grainy than those from competitors.

The **6.67" AMOLED display** brings every image to life. With an in-display fingerprint sensor usually reserved for much more expensive flagships, the Camon 20 offers a premium, modern feel. The screen's 100% DCI-P3 color gamut ensures that the content you create and consume looks exactly as intended.

### Market Position & Ancestry: The Evolution of Camon

The Tecno Camon 20 took the success of the Camon 19 and elevated it with:
- **AMOLED Switch**: Moved from LCD to the superior color-accuracy and contrast of **AMOLED**.
- **Increased Storage**: Standardized **256GB** storage, which is double what many mid-range competitors offer.
- **Design Revolution**: Introduced the bold "Puzzle" aesthetic that moved away from generic smartphone looks.
- **Improved Selfie**: Stayed true to its "Camon" heritage with one of the best 32MP front cameras in its class.

### Software & Daily Productivity

**HiOS 13** provides a fast and customizable experience. Features like **Ella AI** assistant help you manage your schedule, while **Linkbooster** improves internet speeds in areas with weak cellular coverage. The system is also highly efficient at clearing background apps to keep the Helio G85 performance consistent.
