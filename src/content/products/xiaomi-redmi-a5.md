The **6.71-inch display** is one of the best in its category. The inclusion of a **90Hz refresh rate** makes browsing through news feeds on X (Twitter) or scrolling through TikTok feel significantly more responsive than the old 60Hz standard. Furthermore, the DC Dimming technology helps protect your eyes from fatigue during night-time use—a critical feature for students and late-night workers.

### Market Position: The Elegance Champion
