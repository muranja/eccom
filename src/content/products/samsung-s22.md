In Kenya, business owners use the S-Pen to sign digital contracts on the go, engineers mark up site plans, and students take handwritten notes during lectures that automatically convert to text.

The **100x Space Zoom** is powered by a dual-telephoto system.

The AI-enhanced "Super Resolution" mode ensures that even at extreme zoom, the subject remains recognizable and sharp.
